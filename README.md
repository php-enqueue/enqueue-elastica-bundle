# Enqueue Elastica Bundle

Improves performance of `fos:elastica:populate` command from [FOSElasticaBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSElasticaBundle) by distributing the work among consumers.
The performance gain depends on how much consumers you run.
For example 10 consumers may give you 5 to 7 times better performance.
